# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float

num = 30
num = float(30)
print(num)

# 2) Convert a float to an int

num = int(30)
print(num)

# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.

division_result = 777.7 / 60
print(division_result)

# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.

multiplication = division_result * num
print(multiplication)


#
# What information is lost during which conversions?
